# Data and its types

## Defining data
The word data is the plural of the word datum, datum means a single fact that has been recorded, measured, or collected through observations by humans or machines.

The plural data, means the collection of recorded facts and figures. In real life the word data is more commonly used than datum and data is now used to describe both singular and plural quantities.

Something that hasn’t been recorded isn’t data, the memory of your last family vacation is not data but the images and videos that you took on vacation are considered data.

## Tabular data
The first step in working with data is to collect it and data can be collected by any means and you can collect the data of almost anything in the world. The second step in working with data is arranging it in a way that it becomes easier to understand and work with.

The most common way to organize data is through using a table. A table consists of rows and columns in which data is inserted. Each table has multiple rows and columns and the intersection of these rows and columns is called a cell. 

Tables are the most popular way to work with data, programs like Microsoft Excel (spreadsheet application) and MySQL (Database) all use tables to store their data.
Data stored in tables is called tabular data and tabular data contains one row per record (a person, case, event, object, or other data point) and multiple columns containing data about characteristics of the entry. The information that each column represents is often called a field or a variable. 

## Unstructured data
Tabular data is structured data which is very easy to understand and work with but sometimes there is a type of data that can’t be structured easily.

Since, unstructured data doesn’t fit in any rows and columns it is stored in repositories and it has been estimated that almost 80% of all data created is unstructured.

## Semi-structured data
Data that has some metadata (data about data) and tags associated with it falls into the category of semi-structured data and we have to use formats like JSON and XML to make this data understandable.

## Metadata
Metadata is data about data, or data that describes data. Metadata provides basic information about the data, such as when it was created and why, who created the data, where the data was created, the data file size, and other information.

## Variables
A variable is like a box, a box can store anything in it and it can be moved from one place to another and can also be given to others.

It can have a name that can be used to reference it. For example, a variable named shoes can contain a list of all the shoes you own or the shoes that you want to buy.

## Quantitative data
Quantitative data is data that can be counted and is measurable in numbers. It may be weight of people, salaries of employees and the amount of books available to borrow from a library.

## Qualitative data
Data that isn’t countable or measurable in numbers is called qualitative data and we organize this data into different categories that we assign it to. The size of clothing, color of hair, and office locations can be qualitative data.

## Nominal data
Categorized data that is named and listed but isn’t in any order is called nominal data.  Nominal data can include things like office location and the names of employees.

## Ordinal data
Categorized data that isn’t nominal is called ordinal data and can anything from the ranks of soldiers in the army to the different sizes of a shirt at a store.

Another key characteristic of ordinal data is that the space or distance between any two values isn't necessarily the same and while ordinal data is qualitative, it often uses numbers to represent the categories, such as in customer satisfaction surveys

## Discrete data
Discrete data is the quantitative data that can be represented using whole numbers and whole numbers don’t allow fractions or decimals discrete data is used to measure things like the number of employees in an office and the total books in a library.

## Continuous data
Continuous data is numerical data that is between two whole numbers and fractions and decimals can be included in continuous data. The salaries of employees and the total cost of production of an item can be counted as continuous data.
