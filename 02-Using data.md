# How to use data

## The DIKW pyramid
There is almost infinite amount of data available in the world today but that data doesn’t hold any value because of how much it is.

In order to make data valuable for us we process that data into information and that information is used to gain knowledge and that knowledge then becomes wisdom which has the highest value.

The DIKW cycle is like an inverted triangle meaning data is at the top and wisdom is at the bottom since there is tons of data but only few wisdom.
Data, information, and knowledge

Data on its own is meaning less but after we process it we can get some meaningful information and that information helps us to gain knowledge. 
Knowledge comes from accumulated information. Understanding and recognizing patterns is a type of knowledge. 

## Data analysis
Data analysis is the process through which we turn data into information. The most basic form of data analysis is descriptive analysis and it summarizes data that can be used to form a picture of the past. 

Summarizing data tells us the average value for a variable, how frequently a value appears in data, and other useful pieces of knowledge.
Wisdom

Knowledge evolves into wisdom over time and wisdom is used to make judgements and decisions and helps us answer questions that start with why.

The more knowledge we have, the better decisions we can make. Organizations often rely on several sources of data, information, and knowledge to make effective decisions.

## Data-driven decision making
Each step of the DIKW pyramid is a step forward towards wisdom and the last step is where we make decisions and judgements. Progressing further into the pyramid allows us to do data-driven decision making.

Data-driven decision making is the process of only making decisions and judgements based on the wisdom available and not using any other factors.

When following the DIKW pyramid we must be very careful to not make any mistakes in our data analysis process as this can lead to ill-informed decisions along the road.

## Key performance indicators
Key performance indicators or KPIs are tools that organizations use to make data-driven decisions. By tracking important metrics an organization can keep track of its goals and plans and how far it is from achieving them. 

Each type of company will have its own KPIs and different teams inside the company will have their own KPIs that they keep track of since a KPI is a measure of performance it will be different for everyone that is working in a multi-domain workspace.

Previous successful KPIs can be used as benchmarks for newer projects and the project that is most successful in hitting those KPIs will be given more priority. Using the S.M.A.R.T goals framework can help teams meet the required KPIs more easily.

> A S.M.A.R.T goal is a goal that is specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time bound.

## Dashboards

Almost ten thousand workers need to work with data in their full-times jobs and make data-driven decisions based on a recent survey. To make these kind of decisions the employees need all the data that they require to be in one place and easy to understand.

A process known as data democratization makes data accessible to employees at all levels of an organization to improve everyone's decision-making.

> Before data democratization was implemented only the data specialists could access the data of an organization.

To help democratize data, many companies rely on dashboards. The term originates from automobile dashboards, which show several data points in a single panel. A company dashboard serves a similar purpose. It allows viewers to see many metrics all at once.

Organizations often use dashboards to visualize KPIs and make them accessible to the entire organization. Dashboards generally display a mix of data points and charts to highlight current values and trends of important company metrics.

## Data literacy

Democratizing data and establishing goals, KPIs, and targets are critical elements of data-driven decision-making. However, these alone don't guarantee that people will automatically know how to use data to make better decisions.

Data-driven decision-making also requires a certain level of data literacy. There are a variety of definitions of data literacy, but they tend to include the ability to read, work with, analyze, and argue with data.

-   **Reading data** means being able to access and look at the data in a spreadsheet or other location/format, as well as understanding what the data represents.
    
-   **Working with data** includes creating data, as well as cleaning, transforming, organizing, and managing it.
    
-   **Analyzing data** means using any or all of the four levels of data analysis to extract information from the data.
    
-   **Arguing with data** is what happens when we convert data and information into knowledge for decision-making. In other words, the journey down the DIKW Pyramid requires us to argue with data!
    

Being data literate doesn't mean that we have to be data scientists. Nor does it mean that we routinely read, work with, analyze, _and_ argue with data.

> Almost all jobs today require some sort of data literacy.

## Roles in the data field

There are multiple roles in the field of data and you can contribute to it in multiple ways. Companies tend to use different titles for roles in the data field but the core functionality of these is all the same.

The increase in the amount of data and technological advancements to store and analyze it has dramatically increased the opportunities across all these roles.

The most common roles that you'll will find in job postings are these:

**Data Engineer**: data engineers develop, test, and maintain the data architecture. They are involved in the early stages of the data analysis process, making data available to data analysts and data scientists.

They typically are part of a company's engineering team. Data engineers have strong technical backgrounds in programming and databases. Adjacent roles include database administrators and data architects.

**Data Analyst**: data analysts use statistics to organize and analyze data, then extract and communicate insightful information to decision-makers.

They typically rely on programming tools like Python, R, and SQL. The Data Analyst title can vary depending on function (e.g., Business Intelligence Analyst, Database Analyst, Marketing Data Analyst, etc.).

**Data Scientist**: data scientists combine computer science, machine learning, statistics, and math skills to conduct advanced statistical analyses and tests, develop processes for modeling data, and implement algorithms and statistical models to uncover insights from data.

Many popular tech products, such as Google Search and Amazon Alexa, are built on algorithms developed by data scientists. They are considered senior to data analysts. Adjacent roles include machine learning engineers and statisticians.

**Business Analyst**: business analysts translate data insights to help make business decisions. They rely on less technical tools, like Excel, SQL, Power BI, and/or Tableau.

They work collaboratively with other data professionals to translate business requirements and data insights.

Data analysis is just one of their many functions. More and more non-data roles require the use of data for decision-making, such as financial analysts, product managers, project managers, marketers, and many others. For purposes of this course, we'll classify them as business analysts.
